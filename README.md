The scope of the project encompasses the creation of a web-based tool to help diagnose
incoming patients with heart disease based on various patient measurements in the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation. The tool will serve the function of a decision support system for the
cardiology department where the practitioner will manually input the required values. The tool
is intended to analyze the different patient measurements and provide a recommended
diagnosis of Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to the practitioner who will consider the viability
of the result.
The system will be created using python programming language with the implementation of
Dash and scikit-learn libraries to develop machine learning models that will learn the
relationship between the different features of the Cleveland Clinic UCI Heart Disease dataset.
Within the scope of the project is included the preparation, cleaning, and analysis of the dataset
to be used in the training of the machine learning model. As result, the tool is intended to
correctly identify patients with heart disease and provide the accuracy and different evaluation
metrics of the machine learning model.





This project is a group collaboration between  Tara de Groot, Rony Ventura,  Eric Vincent Rivas,
